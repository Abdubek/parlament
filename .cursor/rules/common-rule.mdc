Tech stack:

- The UI framework is **Mantine v8.1.2**.
- Forms are built with `@mantine/form` — do **not** use React Hook Form.
- For date handling, use `dayjs` — avoid `Date` or `date-fns`.
- Routing is handled by `react-router v7.6.2` in **declarative mode** (use `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `<Outlet>`).

Mantine usage:

- Import components only from `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/form`, `@mantine/dates`, `@mantine/dropzone` and `@mantine/hooks`.
- Use `useForm` from `@mantine/form` with `initialValues` and `validate` for form handling.
- Date values inside forms should use `dayjs` objects, not raw strings or `Date`.
- Do not use `withAsterisk`; mark required fields through validation logic.
- Use a clean, modular component style. Avoid `any`; prefer explicit interfaces or types.
- Use bdrs to set the border-radius.

Routing:

- Use `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, and `<Outlet>` in declarative form.
- Use `<Link>` for navigation, and `useNavigate` only inside event handlers.
- Do not overuse `navigate(...)` calls for things that should be expressed through routes.
